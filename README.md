# trivia 

A quiz game created using custom elements derived from lit-element. This exercise shows how to encapsulate features in a custom element so they cannot be tampered with from outside this element. A big plus is the ability to extend these elements and add new features to the new element.

It is using opentdb.com/api.php to fetch trivia questions, options and answers based on a category.
